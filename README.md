# vitasdk code samples

## Prerequisites

In order to build a vita sample, you need to add the toolchain `bin/` directory to your `$PATH`.

## Building

Every samples directory should include a CMake list.
To build a sample, place yourself into this directory and use the `cmake . && make` command to build it.

## Running

To run a sample:
- Send the generated `.vpk` to your vita:
	- Start an FTP server on your vita (for example, with VitaShell - by pressing the select button).
	- Upload the `.vpk` to the Vita using your FTP client (for example, with Curl - with `curl -T *.vpk ftp://YOUR_VITA_IP:1337/ux0:/`)
	- If Curl returns `fatal: No names found, cannot describe anything` it mean that you are trying to overwrite a folder with a file. Add a `/` to the end of your url to explain that you want to upload IN this folder.
- Install the `.vpk` on your vita using a vpk installer (for example, with VitaShell - by pressing the X button on the `.vpk`)
- This will create a new folder in the `ux0:/app/` for the sample.

## Building everything

Use the following command to build every samples:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
